Equivalent dipole source localization of independent components
====================================
{: .no_toc }

A major obstacle to using EEG data to visualize macroscopic brain
dynamics is the underdetermined nature of the inverse problem: Given an
EEG scalp distribution of activity observed at given scalp electrodes,
any number of brain source activity distributions can be found that
would produce it. This is because there is any number of possible brain
source area pairs or etc. that, jointly, add to the scalp data. Therefore, solving this *EEG inverse* problem
requires making additional assumptions about the nature of the
source distributions. A computationally tractable approach is to find
some number of brain current dipoles (like vanishingly small
batteries) whose summed projections to the scalp most nearly resemble
the observed scalp distribution. In this section of the tutorial, we show how to solve this problem using ICA.

Rational for localizing ICA components
---------

Unfortunately, the problem of finding the locations of more than one
simultaneously active equivalent dipoles also does not have a unique
solution, and "best fit" solutions will differ depending on the observed
scalp distribution(s) (or scalp *maps*) that are given to the source
inversion algorithm. For this reason, approaches to solving the EEG
inverse problem have tended to focus on fitting scalp maps in which a
single dipolar scalp map is expected to be active, for instance, very
early peaks in ERP (or magnetic ERF) response averages indexing the
first arrival of sensory information in the cortex. Others attempt to fit
multiple dipoles to longer portions of averaged ERP (or ERF) waveforms
based on "prior belief" (i.e., guesses) as to where the sources *should*
be located. This approach has often been criticized for not being based
wholly on the observed data and thus subject to bias or ignorance.
Using ICA to un-mix the continuous EEG data into brain and non-brain
effective source processes is a radically different approach. ICA
identifies temporally independent signal sources in multi-channel EEG
data as well as their patterns of projection to the scalp electrodes,
which are fixed for spatially stationary sources. These ICA 'component
maps' are significantly more dipolar (i.e.,
"dipole-like") than either the raw EEG or any average ERP at nearly any
time point -- even though neither the locations of the electrodes nor
the biophysics of volume propagation is taken into account by ICA
([Delorme et al.,
2012](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/~scott/pdf/Delorme_Dipolar2012.pdf)). Many
independent EEG components have scalp maps that nearly perfectly match
the projection of a single equivalent brain dipole. 

This finding is
consistent with ICA components presumed generation via partial synchrony of local
field potential (LFP) processes within a connected domain or patch of
cortex. Because
local cortical connections have a much higher density than longer-range
connections, it is reasonable to assume that synchronous coupling of
neuronal activity, as isolated by ICA, usually occurs within a single
brain area. Some ICA component scalp maps do highly resemble the
projection of a single equivalent dipole (or in some cases, a bilaterally
symmetric pair of dipoles). Residual scalp maps variance of the
best-fitting single- or two-dipole component models are often
surprisingly low (see below), given the relative inaccuracy of the
 head models used to compute them. Such ICA components may thus
represent the projection of activity from one (or two symmetric) patch(es)
of cortex.

Fortunately, the problem of finding the location of a single equivalent
dipole generating a given dipolar scalp map is well-posed, given a
sufficiently accurate electrical 'forward problem' head model that
specifies the resistance between each scalp electrode location and each
possible (brain) source location. Mathematically, coherent local field
potential (LFP) activity across a 'cortical patch' will have an
*equivalent* single infinitesimal oriented dipole model whose scalp
projection pattern matches the joint projection of the spatially
coherent activity across the patch. In general, the location of the equivalent
dipole for such a patch will be quite near (\< 2 mm) but not
necessarily precisely at the center of the patch. In particular, if the
patch is radially oriented (e.g., on a cortical gyrus) and is thus
facing the supervening scalp surface, the equivalent dipole tends to be
slightly deeper than the cortical source patch. However, the location of
the equivalent dipole for an *effective source* of this type is
relatively easy to compute and easy to compare across conditions and
subjects. We use the term *effective source* since currents from a
spatially coherent (in-phase) signal across a cortical patch will make a
much larger contribution to the scalp EEG than spatially incoherent
(out-of-phase) activities from smaller domains within the same or any
similar cortical patch because the out-of-phase contributions of the
smaller domains will tend to cancel each other out at the scalp
recording electrode (*phase cancellation*). Thus, even when the actual
LFP magnitudes in a smaller cortical domain are no less than in the
spatially coherent *effective source* patch, their net contribution to
the scalp EEG will be minimal compared to the spatially coherent
*effective source*.

EEGLAB includes two
plugins for localizing equivalent dipole locations of independent
component scalp maps: (1) the DIPFIT plugin described here and (2) the
[Neuroelectromagnetic Forward modeling Toolbox (NFT)](https://github.com/sccn/nft). The DIPFIT plugin is the default approach in EEGLAB. The NFT plugin can also perform distributed cortical source imaging and build individual subject
electrical (forward) head models from an available subjects' MR head image and sufficient EEG.

Dipole fitting with DIPFIT
--------

### Prepare data for component dipole fitting

To fit dipole models to ICA components in an EEGLAB dataset, you must at the very least:
1. Import channel locations using the <span style="color: brown">Edit → Channel locations</span> menu item.
2. High pass filter the data using the <span style="color: brown">Tools → Filter the data → Basic FIR filter</span> menu item.
3. Run independent component analysis using the <span style="color: brown">Tools → Decompose data by ICA</span> menu item.
4. Select head model using the <span style="color: brown"> Tools → Locate dipoles using DIPFIT → Head model and settings</span> menu item.

Refer to the corresponding section of the tutorial for more information on these steps. To illustrate dipole fitting, we will use the tutorial dataset [eeglab_dipole.set](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download/eeglab_dipole.set). This sample dataset contains a channel location file,  pre-computed ICA weights, and head model.

Select menu item <span style="color: brown">File → load existing dataset</span> and select the tutorial file "eeglab_dipoles.set" downloaded above. Then press *Open*.

Before running DIPFIT, we must select a head model. Select the EEGLAB menu item <span style="color: brown"> Tools → Locate dipoles using DIPFIT → Head model and settings</span>, as shown below. Press *Ok* to use all defaults. For additional information on this topic, see the [head model selection](/tutorials/09_source/Model_Settings.html) section of the tutorial.

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew3.png)

### Select components of interest

Next, you must select which component to fit. Independent component (IC)
5 of the sample dataset decomposition is a typical left posterior
alpha rhythm process. To plot component scalp map, use menu item
<span style="color: brown">Plot → Component maps → In 2-D</span>, enter *5* for the component number. Press *Ok*.

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew2.png)

There are two steps required to create equivalent dipole models for
independent components:

-   Grid scanning: This involves scanning possible positions in a coarse
    3-D grid to determine an acceptable starting point for fitting
    equivalent dipoles to each component.
-   Non-linear interactive fitting: This involves running an
    optimization algorithm to find the best position for each equivalent
    dipole.

Below we describe these steps in detail. Note that the grid
scanning and non-linear optimization may also be performed automatically
for a group of selected components. This is described later in this
tutotial.

### Initial fitting - Scanning on a coarse-grained grid

Before you perform interactive dipole fitting, use DIPFIT to
scan for the best-fitting dipole locations on a coarse 3-D grid covering
the whole brain. The solutions of this grid search are not very accurate
yet, but they are acceptable as starting locations for the non-linear
optimization. Starting from these best grid locations will speed up
finding the final best-fitting solution. To scan dipoles on a coarse grid, select
the <span style="color: brown">Tools → Locate dipoles using DIPFIT →
Coarse fit (grid scan)</span> menu item. The window
below will pop up:

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew3bis.png)

The first edit box *Component(s)* allows you to select a subset of
components to fit. Selecting only a few components does not
increase computation speed since the forward model still has
to be computed at each location on the grid. The *Grid in
X-direction*,*Grid in Y-direction*, and *Grid in Z-direction* edit boxes
allow you to specify the size and spacing of the coarse grid. By
default, DIPFIT uses 24 steps equally spaced between -radius and +radius
of the sphere that best matches the electrode positions. Since
equivalent dipoles are not likely to be in the lower hemisphere of the
model head, by default DIPFIT only scans through positive Z values. The
last edit box, *Rejection threshold RV(%)*, allows you to set a
threshold on the maximum residual variance that is accepted. Using this
threshold, components that do not resemble a dipolar field distribution
will not be assigned a dipole location. Press *Ok* to continue.

Progress of the coarse grid
scanning is shown on the MATLAB command window. During dipole localization, the electrode positions are
projected to the skin surface of the spherical or BEM head model, though
the electrode positions of the dataset are *not*
altered. DIPFIT starts the grid scan by first excluding all 3-D grid
locations that are outside the head. It then computes the forward model
(dipole-to-electrode projections) at each remaining grid location and
compares it with all component topographies.

### Plotting dipole locations in 3-D volume

When the process is completed,
select the <span style="color: brown">Tools → Locate dipoles using DIPFIT → Plot component dipoles</span> menu item to call the GUI below:

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew4.png)

Simply press *Ok* to produce the figure below:

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew5.png)

Here, all the dipoles plotted had a residual variance (vis a vis their
component maps) below 40% (as we specified in the coarse grid search
interactive window). Note that some components end up having the same x,
y, and z coordinates because of the coarseness of the grid. You may view
individual components by pressing the *Plot one* button. The component's
residual variance is indicated under its number.

### Plotting dipole locations on scalp maps

Select menu item <span style="color: brown">Plot → Component maps → In 2-D</span>, enter *1:12* in the *Component numbers* edit box to only plot the first 12 components. Check the checkbox to plot associated dipoles and press *Ok*.

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew6.png)

The following plot will pop up. 2-D projections of component associated dipoles are overlaid on components' scalp topographies. Components'
residual variance (in percent) are indicated next to their number.

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew7.png)

### Interactive fine-grained fitting

To scan dipoles interactively, call the <span style="color: brown">Tools → Locate dipoles using DIPFIT →Fine fit (iterative)</span> menu item. The
following window pops up. Enter a component index (here, 5) in the
*Component to fit* edit box.

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew7bis.png)

Prior to fitting this component, press the *Plot map* button to show the
component scalp map. Then press the *Fit dipole(s) position & moment* button to perform fine fitting. Press the *Plot map* button again. The two scalp topographies are shown below (left, before fine fitting; right, after fine fitting). The residual variance decreases from 3.8% to 3%.  

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew8.png)

Note that the polarity of components is not fixed (but their orientation
is): the product of the component scalp map value and the component
activation value (i.e., the back-projected contribution of the
component to the scalp data) is in the original data units (e.g.,
microvolts), but the polarities of the scalp map and of the activation
values are undetermined. For example, you may multiply both the scalp
map and the component activity by -1 while preserving the component
back-projection to the scalp (since the two negative factors cancel
out). As a result, you may choose to flip the visualized dipole
orientations: use the pop-up window for fitting, then press the *Flip
in\|out* button and then the *Plot dipole(s)* button to re-plot the
dipoles with indicated orientations reversed.

<u>Important note:</u> When you are done, press the *Ok* button in the
interactive dipole fitting interface. Do not press *Cancel* or close
the window -- if you do, all the dipole locations computed
using this interface will be lost!

### Fitting symmetrical dipoles

Select component *3* and press the *Plot map* button to visualize this component. This component, showing a clear left-right symmetric activity, cannot be
accurately modeled using a single dipole. To fit this component using
two dipoles constrained to be located symmetrically across the (corpus
callosum) midline, set both dipole 1 and 2 to 'active' and 'fit' (by
checking the relevant checkboxes in the GUI). Then press the *Fit
selected dipole position(s)* button. If fitting fails, enter different
starting positions (e.g., \[-10 -68 17\] for first dipole and \[10 -68
17\] for the second dipole and refit).

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew9.png)

Press the *Plot map* button. When dipole fitting is done, note the
low residual variance for the two-dipole model on the top right corner
of the interactive interface.

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew10.png)

### Automated dipole fitting

Automated dipole fitting performs the grid search and the non-linear
fitting on several components without human intervention. To
find a best-fitting equivalent dipole for component of your choice, select
the EEGLAB <span style="color: brown">Tools → Locate dipoles using
DIPFIT → Autofit (coarse fit, fine fit, plot)</span> menu item. Set the *Component indices* to *5*, enter
*100* in the *rejection threshold* edit box so the iterative solution is
computed regardless of the residual variance for the coarse fit, and
check the *Plot resulting dipoles* checkbox to plot component dipoles at
the end dipole fitting. Then, press *Ok*.

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew11.png)

The function starts by scanning a 3-D grid to determine acceptable
starting positions for each component. Then it uses the non-linear
optimization algorithm to find the exact dipole position for each
component. At the end of the procedure, the following window pops up.

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew12.png)

The [dipplot.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=dipplot.m) function above allows you to rotate the head model
in 3-D with the mouse, and plot MRI slices closest to the equivalent dipole as shown in the following sections.


### Advanced visualization of dipole models

Use the <span style="color: brown">Tools → Locate dipoles using DIPFIT → Plot component dipoles</span> menu item and select component numbers 3 and 5 (assuming you performed the fit for both
components 3 and 5 as described above). Select all options as shown below.

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew13.png)

The following plot pops-up.

![400px\|border](/assets/images/dipfitnew14.png)

Press the *Plot one* button. You may scroll through the components by
pressing the *Next/Prev* buttons. Note that the closest MRI slices to
the dipole being currently plotted are shown. Note also that if you do
not select the option *Plot closest MRI slices* in the graphic
interface, and then press the *Tight view* button in the dipplot window,
you will be able to see the closest MRI slices at the location of the
plotted dipole as shown below. Try moving the 3-D perspective of the
tight view plot with the mouse and/or selecting the three cardinal
viewing angles (sagittal, coronal, top) using the lower-left control
buttons.

![Image:Dipole_tight.gif](/assets/images/Dipole_tight.gif)

Note that it is not possible to toggle the dipole "stems" or
"projection lines" on and off from within the graphic interface. Instead, use the EEGLAB menu item again and unselect the corresponding checkbox.

Finally, again call menu item <span style="color: brown">Tools → Locate dipoles using DIPFIT → Plot component dipoles</span>. Select *Summary mode* and
press *Ok*.

![Image:Dipole_summary.gif](/assets/images/Dipole_summary.gif)

For comparison, using the spherical model, the location of the dipoles
would have been as shown in the following picture (to obtain this picture, select the spherical head model and redo dipole fitting). Notice the similarity
of the Talairach coordinates for the two models. Notice also that the
BEM model does not overestimate dipole depth compare to the spherical
model (which is usually the case when the BEM model mesh is too coarse).
The MRI used to plot the spherical result is the average MNI brain (over
about 150 subjects), whereas the MRI used to plot the BEM is the average
MNI brain of a single subject (which was used to generate the model
leadfield matrix).

![Image:Dipole_summary2.gif](/assets/images/Dipole_summary2.gif)

The entry *Background image* contains the name of the MRI in which to
plot dipoles. You may enter the subject's MRI assuming you have normalized it to the MNI brain. The [SPM software](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) will
take a raw subject MRI as input and normalize it to the MNI brain template.

eLoreta using DIPFIT
--------
DIPFIT also allows computing eLoreta solutions for ICA components. Model settings and coregistration with head model are
the same for eLoreta as for dipole source localization. 

If you have not done so already, load the [eeglab_dipole.set](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download/eeglab_dipole.set) tutorial dataset in EEGLAB. Select menu item <span style="color: brown">File → load existing dataset</span> and select the tutorial file "eeglab_dipoles.set" downloaded above. Then press *Open*.

eLoreta source
localization may be performed using the <span style="color: brown">File
→Locate component using eLoreta</span> menu item. Enter component *5* and press *Ok*.

![](/assets/images/loreta1.png)

Result for this component is shown
below. Like other DIPFIT functions, eLoreta relies on Fieldtrip functions.
Refer to the Fieldtrip *ft_sourceanalysis.m* function help message for more information on eLoreta source localization.

Using DIPFIT to fit independent MEG components
----
It is possible to use DIPFIT to fit MEG components. This [other section of the tutorial](/tutorials/misc/EEGLAB_and_MEG_data.html) contains more details on using EEGLAB to process MEG data.

DIPFIT structures and functions
--------

Like other EEGLAB functions, DIPFIT functions are standalone and may
also be called from the command line. Note that whenever you call some of the
DIPFIT menu items from EEGLAB, a text command is stored in the EEGLAB history
as for any other EEGLAB menu item. The two DIPFIT menu items that generate an EEGLAB history command that can be re-used in batch
scripts are <span style="color: brown">Tools → Locate dipoles using DIPFIT → Autofit</span> and <span style="color: brown">Tools → Locate dipoles using DIPFIT → Head model and settings</span>. Type *eegh* on the MATLAB command line to
view the command history. 

DIPFIT creates a *EEG.dipfit* sub-structure within the main *EEG*
dataset structure. This structure has several fields:

The main DIPFIT functions which can be called from the command line in batch mode are:
- [pop_dipfit_settings.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_dipfit_settings.m): Specify DIPFIT parameters, i.e. head model details.                                                                                                                          
- [pop_multifit.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_multifit.m): Command the DIPFIT modeling process from a single function. This function allows the user to set parameters, initialize locations on a coarse grid, then perform non-linear optimization. This function can be used to automate batch fitting of components from one or more subjects.

Auxiliary DIPFIT functions used by the functions above:
- [dipfitdefs.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=dipfitdefs.m): Defines a set of default values used in DIPFIT.
