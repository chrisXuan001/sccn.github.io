Time/frequency decomposition
=================================

Time/frequency analysis characterizes changes or perturbations in the
spectral content of the data considered as a sum of windowed sinusoidal
functions (i.e., sinusoidal wavelets). There are a long history and much
recent development of methods for time/frequency decomposition. 
The methods used in the basic EEGLAB functions are straightforward. Their
mathematical details are given in a reference paper [(Delorme and
Makeig, 2004)](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download/eeglab_jnm03.pdf).
You may also want to watch the short series of videos on computing time-frequency decompositions in EEGLAB (hosted on Youtube) below. If you click on the icon on the top right corner, you can see the list of all the videos in the playlist.

ERSP and ITC time-frequency analysis
------------------------------

### Time-frequency images
We use here the tutorial dataset as it was after extracting data epochs. Select the <span style="color: brown">File → load existing dataset</span> menu item and select the tutorial file "eeglab_data_epochs_ica.set" located in the "sample_data" folder of EEGLAB. Then press *Open*.

To detect transient *event-related spectral perturbation,* or ERSP,
[(Makeig, 1993)](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/~scott/ersp93.html)
(event-related shifts in the power spectrum) and inter-trial coherence
(ITC) (event-related phase-locking) events in epoched EEGLAB datasets,
select <span style="color: brown">Plot → Time-frequency transforms → Channel time-frequency</span> calling the [pop_newtimef.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_newtimef.m) function. Below, we
enter *14* (Cz) for the *Channel number*. We let the other defaults remain. We press *Ok*.

Note the default "Wavelet cycles" entry is *3 0.8*.
As explained in the help message for the *newtimef.m* function, this means
that the wavelet used to measure the amount and phase of the data in
each successive, overlapping time window will begin with a 3-cycle
wavelet (with a Hanning-tapered window applied). The '0.8' here means
that the number of cycles in the wavelets used for higher frequencies
will continue to expand slowly, reaching 20% (1 minus 0.8) of the number of
cycles in the equivalent FFT window at its highest frequency. This
controls the shapes of the individual time/frequency windows measured
by the function and their shapes in the resulting time/frequency
panes. 

*Note*: This information does not set the lowest frequency to be
analyzed. By current default, the lowest frequency window is about 0.5
seconds long. Using three cycles in 0.5 seconds sets the lowest frequency
analyzed to about 6 Hz. To make this lowest frequency near 3 Hz, we
would need to add the optional *newtimef.m* argument " 'winlen',
xxx " where xxx is the sampling rate of the data (also
shown on the blue EEGLAB menu window). This would specify that the
window length ('winlen') at the lowest frequency should be xxx samples
long (i.e., 1 sec long). If we were using 1 cycle, the lowest frequency
would be 1 Hz. With 3 cycles, the lowest frequency is 3 Hz.

The window below appears:
 
 ![](/assets/images/newtimefplot1.png)

 - The **top image** shows
mean event-related changes in spectral power (from pre-stimulus
baseline) at each time during the epoch and at each frequency (\< 50
Hz). To inspect these changes more closely, click on the color image.
A new window will pop up. Enabling MATLAB zoom allows zooming into
any desired time/frequency window. The ERSP image shows a brief decrease in power at about 370 ms at 8 Hz (click on the
image to zoom in and determine the exact frequency), a power increase
centered at 13.5 Hz and starting at 300 ms. More spectral changes
occur at 20-28 Hz. The left panel adjacent to the top image shows the baseline mean power spectrum, and the
lower part of the top image, the ERSP envelope (low and high mean dB
values, relative to baseline, at each time in the epoch).

- The **lower image** shows  the Inter-Trial coherence (ITC) at all
frequencies. We previously encountered the ITC when we explained the 
[ERP image plotting](tutorials/08_Plot_data/Plotting_ERP_images.html). A significant ITC indicates
that the EEG activity at a given time and frequency in single trials
becomes phase-locked (not phase-random with respect to the
time-locking experimental event). Here, ITC
briefly increases at about 10 Hz (at about the same time as the power increase
in the *upper panel*). 

The help message for the 
[newtimef.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=newtimef.m)
 function contains information about its parameters, the images
and curve plotted, and their meanings.

*Note*: You may change the optional parameter *padratio* to increase frequency resolution. For example, setting the *padratio* to *16* would give a smooth looking plot at quite some unnecessary computational cost. 

### Masking for significance

Select <span style="color: brown">Plot → Channel time-frequency</span> and 
enter *14* (Cz) for the *Channel number*. Use *.05* for the *Bootstrap
significance level*, and check the *FDR correct* checkbox to correct for multiple
comparisons using the False Discovery Rate method (see statistics [Appendix](/tutorials/ConceptsGuide/statistics_theory.html) for more information). Press *Ok*.

![](/assets/images/newtimef2.png)

The window below appears:
 
 ![](/assets/images/newtimefplot2.png)

 Note that the
time/frequency points showing significant ITC and ERSP are not
necessarily identical. ERSP reaches significance over the regions described in the previous section. However, ITC does not reach significance. Note also that the method used to assess significance is based on random data shuffling, so these features' exact significance limits may appear slightly different.

### Time-frequency curves

In addition to plotting time-frequency images, it is also possible to plot
time-frequency curves at given frequencies. Select <span style="color: brown">Plot → Channel time-frequency</span> and 
enter 
- *1* (FPz) for the *Channel number*
- Enter *5 10 20* in the *Frequency limit* edit box and select *Use actual freq.* in the adjacent dropdown list
- Check the checkbox *Plot curve at each frequency*

Press *Ok*.

The window below appears:

 The plot above shows fluctuations in spectral power and ITC through time at the chosen frequencies. This plotting format does not allow masking for significance.

Advanced ERSP/ITC plotting
---------------------
Recall that spectral perturbations at a single-analysis frequency and
channel in the single epochs (sorted by some relevant
value) can be imaged using [erpimage.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=erpimage.m) or by selecting menu item <span style="color: brown">Plot → Component → Channel ERP image</span>.

Called from the command line, 
the [pop_newtimef.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_newtimef.m) and [newtimef.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=newtimef.m) routines can return the data for each part of their figures as a MATLAB variable. Accumulating the
ERSP and ITC images (plus the ERSP baseline and significance-level
information) for all channels allows using
another toolbox routine, [tftopo.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=tftopo.m) (currently unavailable from the EEGLAB menu). See the [EEGLAB script writing](/tutorials/11_Scripting/) tutorial for more details.
