Where to learn EEG
=======

There are many ressources to learn EEG. One we like is the [learningeeg.com](https://www.learningeeg.com/) website. It is meant for neurology residents, epilepsy or clinical neurophysiology fellows, and EEG technicians. However, it is well suited for aspiring EEG researchers as well.
