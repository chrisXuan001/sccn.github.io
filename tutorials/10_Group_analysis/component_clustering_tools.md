Clustering ICA components
===========================

This part of the tutorial will demonstrate how to use EEGLAB to
interactively preprocess, cluster, and then visualize the dynamics of
ICA (or other linear) signal components across one or many subjects by
operating on one of the tutorial *STUDY*.

Why cluster ICA components?
-----------------

### Is my Cz your Cz?

To compare electrophysiological results across
subjects, the usual practice of most researchers has been to identify
scalp channels (for instance, considering recorded channel Cz in every
subject's data to be spatially equivalent). Actually, this is an
idealization, since the spatial relationship of any physical electrode
site (for instance, Cz, the vertex in the International 10-20 System
electrode labeling convention) to the underlying cortical areas that
generate the activities summed by the (Cz) channel may be rather
different in different subjects, depending on the physical locations,
extents, and particularly the orientations of the cortical source areas,
both in relation to the 'active' electrode site (e.g., Cz) and/or to its
recorded reference channel (for example, the nose, right mastoid, or
other sites).

That is, data recorded from equivalent channel locations (Cz) in
different subjects may sum the activity of different mixtures of underlying
cortical EEG sources, no matter how accurately the equivalent electrode
locations were measured on the scalp. This fact is commonly ignored in
EEG research.

### Is my IC your IC?

Following ICA (or other linear) decomposition,
however, there is no natural and easy way to identify a component from
one subject with one (or more) component(s) from another subject. A pair
of independent components (ICs) from two subjects might resemble and/or
differ from each other in many ways and to different degrees -- by
differences in their scalp maps, power spectra, ERPs, ERSPs, ITCs, or
etc. Thus, there are many possible (distance) measures of similarity
and many different ways of combining activity measures into a global
distance measure to estimate component pair similarity.

Thus, the problem of identifying equivalent components across subjects
is non-trivial. EEGLAB contains functions and
supporting structures for flexibly and efficiently performing and
evaluating component clustering across subjects and conditions (see [2004](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/papers/PLOS04_animation.html) and [2005](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/papers/OntonTheta05.html)). With its
supporting data structures and stand-alone *std_* prefix analysis
functions, EEGLAB makes it possible to summarize results of ICA-based
analysis across more than one condition from a large number of subjects.
This makes more routine use of linear decomposition and ICA
possible to apply to a wide variety of hypothesis testing on datasets
from several to many subjects.

Note that independent component clustering (like much other data clustering)
has no single *correct* solution. Interpreting the results of component
clustering, therefore, warrants caution. Claims to the discovery of
physiological facts from component clustering should be accompanied by
thoughtful caveat and, preferably, by results of statistical testing
against suitable null hypotheses.

Prepare data for ICA component clustering
---

### Load and prepare data

In this tutorial, we will use a [5-subject STUDY](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download/STUDY5subjects.zip) (450Mb). See the [STUDY creation tutorial](/tutorials/10_Group_analysis/study_creation.html) for more information on this data. Select menu item <span style="color: brown">File</span> and press sub-menu item <span style="color: brown">Load existing study</span>. Select the tutorial file "N400.study" then press *Open*.

The *STUDY* above is ready for clustering, but the following steps are usually required before clustering ICA components.
- You have created a *STUDY* with the data from all participants in your experiment. See [STUDY creation](/tutorials/10_Group_analysis/study_creation.html) tutorial.
- You have added channel locations. Note that channel
locations may be edited for all datasets at the same time (simply use
menu item <span style="color: brown">Edit → Channel locations</span>). 
- You have run ICA on each dataset. Use menu item <span style="color: brown">Tools → Decompose data by ICA</span> to run ICA on all datasets if this is not the case.
- You have fitted each ICA component with a dipole. If this is not the case, use menu item <span style="color: brown">Tools → Locate dipoles using DIPFIT -> Head model and settings</span>, and then <span style="color: brown">Tools → Locate dipoles using DIPFIT -> Autofit</span>.
- You have regularly saved your changes using menu item <span style="color: brown">File → Save current study</span>. You can save the
updated *STUDY* set to disk, either overwriting the current version - by
leaving the default file name in the text box - or by entering a new
file name.

### Select components to cluster

Then select the menu item <span style="color: brown">Study → Edit study info</span>. The following interface pops up.

![](/assets/images/studyclust1.png)

We have already described this interface when importing data in a *STUDY* in the [STUDY creation tutorial](/tutorials/10_Group_analysis/study_creation.html). The bottom checkbox removes all current cluster information, and you need to check this checkbox if you want to remove all clusters or if you have added or removed datasets (because the modified *STUDY* would not be consistent with the already computed clusters). The button *Select by r.v.* allows
you to set a threshold for residual variance of the dipole model
associated with each component. Press this button. The entry box below will appear. 

![](/assets/images/studyclust2.png)

This interface allows specifying that components used in clustering
will only be those whose equivalent dipole models have residual dipole
variance of their component map, compared to the best-fitting
equivalent dipole model projection to the scalp electrodes, less than
a specified threshold (0% to 100%). The default r.v. value is 15%,
meaning that only components with dipole models' residual variance of
less than 15% will be included in clusters. This is useful because of
the modeled association between components with near *dipolar* (or
sometimes dual-dipolar) scalp maps with physiologically plausible
components, those that may represent the activation in one (or two
coupled) brain area(s). For instance, in the interface above, the
default residual variance threshold is set to 15%. This means that
only components that have equivalent dipole models with less than 15%
of residual variance will be selected for clustering (see [this article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25234117/) for a justification of the 15% threshold). Pressing *Ok* will
cause the component column to be updated in the main study-editing
window.

The *Comp.* buttons contains the
components for each dataset that will be clustered based on the residual variance threshold selected above. You may edit these manually. Note that if you
change the component selection (by pressing the relevant push button),
all datasets with the same subject name and the same session number
will also be updated (as these datasets have the same
ICA decompositions).

Press *Ok* in the *STUDY* editing GUI to save your changes.

### Multiple ICA decompositions per subject
 
Continuous data collected in one task or
experiment session are often separated into epochs defining different
task conditions (for example, separate sets of epochs time-locked to
targets and non-targets, respectively). Datasets from different
conditions collected in the same *session* are assumed by the clustering
functions to have the same ICA component weights (i.e., the same ICA
decomposition is assumed to have been applied to the data from all
session conditions at once). If this was not the case, then datasets
from the different conditions must be assigned to different
*sessions*.

So, we recommend performing one ICA decomposition on all the data
collected in each data collection session, even when several
conditions are involved. In our experience, ICA can return a more stable
decomposition when trained on more data. Having components with common
spatial maps also makes it easier to compare component behaviors across
conditions. To use the same ICA decomposition for several conditions,
simply run ICA on the continuous or epoched data *before* extracting
separate datasets corresponding to specific task conditions of interest.
Then extract specific condition datasets; they will automatically
inherit the same ICA decomposition. We followed this procedure for the tutorial data used on this page.

### Compute component activity measures

The next step before clustering is to precompute component activity measures for each dataset. Precomputing measure is necessary to cluster components but it is also necessary to visualize component activities. Note that the GUI for precomputing component activity measures is similar to the GUI for precomputing channel activity described in the [channel visualization tutorial](/tutorials/10_Group_analysis/study_data_visualization_tools.html).

Select menu item <span style="color: brown">Study → Precompute component measures</span>. In the interface below, select all measures. For ERSP/ITC, select 30 frequencies and 60 time points to speed up computation,  as shown below. Press *Ok*.

![](/assets/images/studyclust3.png)

It should take a few minutes to precompute all measures.

Cluster components
-----------------

The main method to cluster components in EEGLAB is the *PCA clustering method* described below. Other methods are the *Measure Projection method* and the *Scalp Correlation method* available in EEGLAB plugins as indicated in a subsequent section.

### Building a preclustering matrix

The aim of the preclustering interface is to build a global distance
matrix specifying *distances* between components for use by the
clustering algorithm. This component *distance* is typically abstract,
estimating how *far* the components' maps, dipole models, and/or
activity measures are from one another in the space of the joint,
PCA-reduced measures selected. This will become clearer as we detail the use of the graphic interface below.

The condition means used to construct
this overall cluster *distance* measure may be selected from a palette
of standard EEGLAB measures: ERP, power spectrum, ERSP, and/or ITC, as
well as the component scalp maps (interpolated to a standard scalp grid) and their equivalent dipole model locations. Note that dipole locations are the one type of preclustering information *not* precomputed since it is readilly available in each dataset.

Invoke the preclustering graphic interface ([pop_preclust.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_preclust.m) function) by using menu item
<span style="color: brown">Study → PCA clustering (original) → Build preclustering array</span> function  and its GUI interface described below first computes
desired condition-mean measures used to determine the cluster *distance* of components from each other. 

![](/assets/images/studyclust4.png)

The checkboxes on the left in the second section of the [pop_preclust.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_preclust.m) interface above allow selection of the
component activity measures to include in the *cluster location
measure* constructed to perform clustering. 

The goal of the
preclustering function is to compute an N-dimensional cluster
position vector for each component. These *cluster position* vectors
will be used to measure the *distance* of components from each other
in the N-dimensional cluster space. The N-dimensional vector incorporates information from PCA-reduced ERP, ERSP, or other measures. The value of N is arbitrary but, because of constraints imposed by clustering algorithms, should be kept relatively low (about 10, e.g., \<3 or less per measure). 

In the cluster position vectors, for
example, the three first values might represent the 3-D (x, y, z)
spatial locations of the equivalent dipole for each component. The
next, say, 2 values might represent the largest 2 principal
components of the first condition ERP, the next 2, for the second
condition ERP, and so on. If you are computing (time/frequency) spectral perturbation images,
you cannot use all their (near-3000) time-frequency values. Here also, you should use the *Dim.* column
inputs to reduce the number of dimensions (for instance, to 2 or 3).

#### Dimension normalization
 
You may wish to *normalize* these principal dimensions for the location
and activity measures you select so their metrics are equivariant across
measures. Do this by checking the checkbox under the *norm* column. 
This
*normalization* process involves dividing the measure data of all
principal components by the standard deviation of the first PCA
component for this measure. 

You may also specify a relative weight
(versus other measures). For instance, if you use two measures (A and B)
and you want A to have twice the"weight of B, you would normalize both
measures and enter a weight of 2 for A and 1 for B. If you estimate that
measure A has more relevant information than measure B, you could also
enter a greater number of PCA dimension for A than for B.

#### Component measures

All the measures described below, once computed, can be used
for clustering and/or for cluster visualization. First, we have the time-based measures.

-   *Spectra:* The first checkbox allows you to include the log mean
    power spectrum for each condition in the preclustering measures.
    Clicking on the checkbox allow you to enter power spectral
    parameters. In this case, a frequency range \[lo hi\] (in Hz) is
    required. Note that for clustering purposes (but not for display),
    for each subject individually, the mean spectral value (averaged
    across all selected frequencies) is subtracted from all selected
    components, and the mean spectral value at each frequency (averaged
    across all selected components) is subtracted from all components.
    The reason is that some subjects have larger EEG power than others.
    If we did not subtract the (log) means, clusters might contain
    components from only one subject, or from one type of subject (e.g., men, who often have thinner skulls and therefore larger EEG than women).
    
-   *ERPs:* The second checkbox computes mean ERPs for each condition.
    Here, an ERP latency window \[lo hi\] (in ms) is required.
    
-   *ERSPs and/or ITCs:* The following two checkboxes allow including
    event-related spectral perturbation information in the form of
    event-related spectral power changes (ERSPs), and event-related
    phase consistencies (ITCs) for each condition.

Second, we have the location-based measures.
    
-   *Dipole locations:* The third checkbox allows you to include component equivalent dipole locations in the preclustering process. Dipole
    locations (shown as \[x y z\]) automatically have three dimensions. It is also possible to cluster on dipole orientations. As mentioned before, the equivalent dipole model for each component and
    dataset must already have been precomputed. If one component is    modeled using two symmetrical dipoles, the [pop_preclust.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_preclust.m)
    function will use the average location of the two dipoles for clustering.
    
-   *Scalp maps:* The last checkbox allows you to include scalp map
    information in the component *cluster location*. You may choose to
    use raw component map values, their laplacians, or their spatial
    gradients. We have obtained fair results for main components
    using laplacian scalp maps, though there are still better reasons to
    use equivalent dipole locations instead of scalp maps. 
    You may also
    select whether or not to use only the absolute map values, their
    advantage being that they do not depend on (arbitrary) component map    polarity. We do not recommend to use dipole *and* scalp map information as the information is redundant.

In the [pop_preclust.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_preclust.m) interface shown above, select only the dipole checkboxes and leave all
default parameters (including the dipole residual variance filter at the top of the window). The total number of dimension is the sum of the dimension for all selected measures (in our case, 3+3 = 6). Clustering
    algorithms may not work well with more than 10 dimensions, especially if the number of components is limited. In our case, the number of dimensions (6) compared to the number of components (151, elected based on residual variable threshold) is acceptable.

 Press *Ok*.

### Applying the clustering algorithm

You may call the [pop_clust.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_clust.m) cluster function interface by selecting the <span style="color: brown">Study → PCA clustering (original) → Cluster components</span> menu item, as shown below.

![](/assets/images/studyclust5.png)

Several algorithms are available: *kmeans*, *neural network*, *affinity*, and *affinity* clustering.

*Kmeans* requires the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox, while *neural network* clustering uses a function from the MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox. A version of *kmeans* that does not require the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox is also available. *Affinity* clustering does not require any toolbox. We recommend using *affinity* clustering which does not require to specify the number of clusters, then try the *kmeans* algorithm if the results are not satisfactory. 

For *kmeans*, note that the default number of clusters is set so on average
there will be one computed per subject per cluster. For example, if
about 20 components per subjects are selected based on the residual
variance threshold and the *STUDY* contains 10 subjects, the average
number of cluster will be set to 20 - so each cluster will contains on
average 10 components. In this case, we have a reduced number of subject, so enter 11 to increase the number of component per cluster.
 
An option for the *kmeans.m* algorithm can relegate
*outlier* components to a separate cluster. Outlier components are
defined as components further than a specified number of standard
deviations (3, by default) from any of the cluster centroids. To turn
on this option, click the upper checkbox on the left. Identified
outlier components will be placed into a designated *Outliers* cluster
(Cluster 2).

Press *Ok*. The cluster editing interface detailed in one of the following sections will automatically pop up.

Optimal Kmeans clustering
-----------------
We have recently added *Optimal Kmeans* algorithm to the `pop_clust` function. This feature allows you to find the optimal number of clusters for your data. To use this feature, you need to have the [MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html) installed.

To use this feature, you need to select the *Optimal Kmeans* option from the *Clustering algorithm* dropdown menu. Then, you need to input a range of cluster numbers to test (in the screenshot below minimum is set to 10 and maximum is set to 30). The algorithm will then test the clustering for each number of clusters in the range and chooses the optimal number of clusters based on the *silhouette* score. The *silhouette* score is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The optimal number of clusters is the one that maximizes the *silhouette* score. Read more about the *silhouette* score from the [MATLAB documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/clustering.evaluation.silhouetteevaluation.html).

*Recommended number of clusters:* Following the rationale for estimated number of clusters above, we recommend setting the lower bound of the cluster range to the half the average number of components per subject. For example, if there are 20 components per subject, set the lower bound to 10. Similarly, set the upper bound to 1.5 times the average number of components per subject. For example, for 20 components per subject, set the upper bound to 30. If the returned number of clusters is at its lower or upper bound, consider expanding the range. We also strongly recommend using the option to separate outliers.

![](/assets/images/studyclust14.png)

Other clustering methods
-----------------
The main method to cluster components in EEGLAB is the *PCA clustering method* described in this tutorial. Other methods are the *Measure Projection method* and the *Scalp Correlation method* available in the EEGLAB plugins described below.

### Finding clusters with the Measure Projection plugin
Using measure projection, IC measures (ERP, ERSP..., except equivalent dipoles), are compared for each IC pair and their dissimilarity is multiplied to form a combined pairwise dissimilarity matrix. This matrix is then normalized, weighted, and added to the normalized and weighted IC equivalent dipole distance matrix. The final dissimilarity
matrix is then clustered using affinity clustering method. Refer to the plugin [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sccn/mp_clustering) for details.

### Finding clusters with the Corrmap plugin
Corrmap is an EEGLAB plugin that clusters
components based on the correlation of their scalp topographies. The
documentation for this plugin is available on 
[Stefan Debener web page](http://www.debener.de/corrmap/corrmapplugin1.html) and the plugin [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sccn/corrmap).

Visualizing component clusters
----------------------------
Call the cluster editing function [pop_clustedit.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_clustedit.m) using
menu item <span style="color: brown">Study → Edit → plot clusters</span>. This will open the following window. 

Note that the clustering menu item <span style="color: brown">Study → PCA clustering (original) → Cluster components</span> we used in a previous section will also call automatically this window after clustering has finished.

![](/assets/images/studyclust6.png)

Of the 305 components in the sample *N400* *STUDY*, dipole model
residual variances for 151 components were below 15%. Other components
were omitted from clustering. The selected components were
clustered on the basis of their dipole locations into 11 component clusters, and one outlier cluster.

Selecting one of the clusters from the list
shown in the upper left box displays a list of the cluster components in the text box on the upper right. The *All cluster centroids*
option in the (left) text box list will cause the function to display
results for all but the *ParentCluster*.
Selecting one of the plotting options will then show all cluster centroids in a single figure. To review all cluster dipole locations, press the *Plot
dipoles* button in the left column. This will open the plot viewer
showing all the cluster component dipoles (in blue), plus the cluster
mean dipole location (in red). Not surprisingly, components have been clustered in groups of dipoles with distinct locations.

![](/assets/images/studyclust8.png)

You may also review cluster scalp maps, by pressing the *Plot scalp maps* option. This will produce the figure below:

![](/assets/images/studyclust7.png)

Note that your exact clusters might differ slightly since the *kmean* algorithm starts from a random assignment of components to clusters.

In computing the mean cluster scalp maps (or scalp map centroids), the
polarity of each of the cluster's component maps was first adjusted so
as to correlate positively with the cluster mean (recall that component
maps have no absolute polarity). Then the map variances were equated.
Finally, the normalized means were computed.

To see individual component scalp maps for components in the cluster,
select the cluster of interest in the left column (for example, *Cluster 6* as in the figure above). Then press the *Plot scalp maps* option in the
right column. The following figure will appear (Note that, in your case, this cluster might be a different index).

![](/assets/images/studyclust9.png)

Here, *SO2 IC6* means *independent component 6 for subject SO2*, etc. 

Note that channels missing from any of the datasets do not affect clustering or visualization of cluster scalp maps. Component scalp maps are interpolated by the [toporeplot.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=toporeplot.m) function, avoiding the need
to restrict *STUDY* datasets to a common *always clean* channel subset
or to perform *missing channel* interpolation on individual datasets.

You may also plot scalp maps for individual components in the cluster by selecting components in the right column and then pressing *Plot scalp maps* (not shown).

You may plot the dipoles for this cluster. Press the *Plot dipoles* button in the left or right column. The following image pops up.

![](/assets/images/studyclust11.png)

Scroll through the dipoles one by
one, rotating the plot in 3-D or selecting among the three cardinal
views (lower left buttons), etc. Information about the plotted dipoles is
presented in the left-center side bar (see the image above).

Let's also plot the spectrum for this cluster along with the spectrum of the individual components. In the right column, click on the *Plot spectra* button.

![](/assets/images/studyclust10.png)

We can see a clear 10 Hz peak in all the components of this cluster. Let's finally plot the ERPs for the two conditions of this *STUDY*. Click on the *Params* button in the central column adjacent to the *Plot ERPs* buttons. Change the time range to -200 ms to 1000 ms as shown below. Check the checkbox to plot the first independent variable on the same plot. Press *Ok*. 

![](/assets/images/studyclust12.png)

Then click on the *Plot ERPs* button in the right column. The following window pops up.

![](/assets/images/studyclust13.png)

Here Cluster 6 accounts for some central
occipital alpha activity -- note the strong 10-Hz peak in the activity
spectra. The cluster ERPs show a very slow (1-Hz) pattern. The
apparent latency shift between conditions in the slow wave activity may or may not be significant.

To quickly recognize the nature of component clusters by their activity features requires experience (see the [ICA decomposition tutorial](http://localhost:4000/tutorials/06_RejectArtifacts/RunICA.html) for more information).

Editing clusters
-----------------
The results of clustering can also be updated manually in the cluster viewing and
editing window (called from the <span style="color: brown">Study → Edit/plot clusters</span> menu item). These editing options allow flexibility for
adjusting the clustering results. Components can be reassigned to different
clusters, new clusters can be created, and
*outlier* components can be rejected from a cluster. Note that if you make changes via the [pop_clustedit.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_clustedit.m) GUI, then wish to
cancel these changes, pressing the *Cancel* button will cause the
*STUDY* changes to be forgotten.

![](/assets/images/studyclust6.png)

We describe below the four button to edit clusters.

- *Renaming a cluster.* The *Rename selected cluster* option allows
you to rename any cluster using a (mnemonic) name of your choice.
Pressing this option button opens a pop-up window asking for the new
name of the selected cluster. For instance, if you think a cluster
contains components accounting for eye blinks you may rename it
"Blinks".

- *Removing selected outlier components manually.* You may remove *outlier* components from a cluster manually. This
option allows you to de-select seeming *outlier* components irrespective
of their distance from the cluster mean. To manually reject components,
first select the cluster of interest from the list on the left, then
select the desired *outlier* component(s) from the component list on the
right, then press the *Remove selected outlier comps* button. A
confirmation window will pop up.

- *Creating a new cluster.* To create a new empty cluster, press the
*Create new cluster* option. This opens a pop-up window asking for a
name for the new cluster. If no name is given, the default name is 'Cls
\#', where '\#' is the next available cluster number. For changes to
take place, press the *Ok* button in the pop-up window. The new empty
cluster will appear as one of the clusters in the list on the left of
the editing/viewing cluster window.

- *Reassigning components to clusters.* To move components between
any two clusters, first select the origin cluster from the list on the
left, then select the components of interest from the component list on
the right, and press the *Reassign selected component(s)* option button.
Select the target cluster from the list of available clusters.

Further component clustering consideration
----------------------------

### Multiple components from the same subjects in ICA clusters
When plotting ICA clusters, EEGLAB allows by default several components
from the same subject to be included in a given cluster. This can sometimes cause problems when using statistics. 

When you include more than one component from the same subject, you are not making inferences
about the general population of subjects anymore but instead about
components of the specific subjects you are studying. It is all a matter
of how many components you have per subject compared to the number of
subjects. 

For example, if you have on average one component per subject
(some subjects having 0, some other two components in the cluster), and you
have 200 subjects, then the original null hypothesis (which allows
making inferences about the general population of subjects) is mostly
preserved. If you have 10 subjects and 10 components of the same subject in a given cluster, it is
not.

In general, when multiple components from the same subjects in ICA
clusters becomes a problem, we prefer to use at most one
component per subject per cluster because this avoids having to
compromise with the statistics (this is possible when using the EEGLAB Corrmap
plugin for clustering data). Alternatively, remove components manually in clusters.

### Choice of *STUDY* design for clustering

When preclustering ICA components, the current *STUDY* design is taken into account. 

For example, if you have two conditions per subject and
both conditions share the same set of ICA components, then during
preclustering, when computing the component distance measure used for
clustering, data measures from both conditions are concatenated. For
example, when using the mean power spectrum to cluster components,
instead of having say 50 spectral values (one per frequency) for each
component, during preclustering 100 values (two sets of 50 frequencies,
one for each condition) will be placed one after the other. EEGLAB will
not allow you to cluster components using a *STUDY* design that does not
include all *STUDY* datasets. Note that you are using anatomical component information only (scalp
topographies and/or equivalent dipoles) and no other measures to cluster
components, then the *STUDY* design does not impact the clustering
solution.

To precluster, therefore, we
advise using the simplest *STUDY* design possible. Often, this is the one
that is most natural for the experiment. After clustering, since all ICA components are included in the
clustering, ICA clusters are constant for all conditions and STUDY
designs. Thus, once your components
are clustered, it is possible to compare cluster activities for any *STUDY* design.

### Comparing clusters' activity in different conditions

Once ICA components are clustered, it is possible to *compute
differences between conditions* using any *STUDY* design. Whenever you
select a different design, ICA components are assigned to the conditions
in the design according to your design as per the clustering solution.
For example, if you have only one ICA decomposition per subject and a
2x1 design (2 conditions, 1 subject group, collected in 1 session), then
both conditions share the same components.

Comparing activities of ICA components between conditions is like
comparing activities in different data channels. Comparing the
activities of a cluster of components between conditions could be seen
as similar to comparing the activity of a given channel across subjects. 
Remember that ICA components and
electrode channels are both <em>spatial filters.</em> Each data
channel is the arithmetic difference between the potential reaching
some scalp electrode and the potential reaching a reference electrode
(or the mean of the potentials reaching the set of reference
electrodes). Each ICA component gives the arithmetic weighted
sum/difference of the signals reaching each of the electrodes. Here the
negatively weighted electrode signals can be said to serve the role of
the reference channel (although this channel combination will typically
be different for each component).

For *STUDY* designs in which component activities of two subject groups
are to be compared, the computed measure differences will be between
components for each group within each cluster.

Try it on your own data
----
Note that with only a few subjects and a few clusters (a necessary
limitation to distribute the tutorial example easily), it may not be
possible to find consistent component clusters with uniform and
easily identifiable natures. We have obtained much more satisfactory
results when clustering data from 15 to 30 or more subjects.

After following this tutorial using the sample data, we recommend you
create a study for a larger group of datasets whose
properties you know well. Then try clustering components of this study in
