Select a file and press **Open**. The import function will then prompt you about which MFF field or key should be mapped to EEGLAB data type. The selection will depend on your experiment and how you are collecting information during raw data collection. The field MFF event **Code** usually contains relevant information that may be used for EEGLAB type. Note that a combination of fields or keys may be selected. If you select more than one field, the import function will concatenate the field for each event.

Once you press OK, the import function will import the data and show the result in the main EEGLAB graphic interface.

You may then use EEGLAB as you would with any other dataset. Refer to the [EEGLAB tutorial](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB_Wiki) for more information.
