After [editing the STUDY for group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/wiki/Between-Subjects-Categorical-Designs), we have the same Beta files as before, but also txt files split per group which makes file selection easier.  

From the 2nd level GUI ([figure 9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/9.jpg)), after creating/selecting a working directory and have selected your group level channel location file (likely in the /derivative root folder) select ANOVA, Repeated Measures ANOVA, Full scalp analysis, enter 2 groups, the finally select to use betas ; picking up iteratively list of beta files per group ([figure 36](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/36.jpg)). As before you also have to enter factors (here 3) and indicate the relevant beta parameters (here [1:3]).

These steps can be executed in command line as:  
```matlab
mkdir('Gp-Conditions_ANOVA'); cd('Gp-Conditions_ANOVA');
chanlocs = [STUDY.filepath filesep 'limo_gp_level_chanlocs.mat'];
Files = cell(2,1); % groups in rows, repeated measures in columns  
Files{1} = fullfile(STUDY.filepath,['LIMO_' STUDY.filename(1:end-6)],'Beta_files_Gp1_ANOVA_Faces_GLM_Channels_Time_WLS.txt');  
Files{2} = fullfile(STUDY.filepath,['LIMO_' STUDY.filename(1:end-6)],'Beta_files_Gp2_ANOVA_Faces_GLM_Channels_Time_WLS.txt');  
LIMOPath = limo_random_select('Repeated Measures ANOVA',chanlocs,'LIMOfiles',Files,...  
    'analysis_type','Full scalp analysis','parameters',{[1 2 3];[1 2 3]},...
    'factor names',{'face'},'type','Channels','nboot',1000,'tfce',0,'skip design check','yes');
```

Output files are now the main effect of faces, the main effect of group and the interaction gp*faces. Results for the main effect are similar to the one-way ANOVA with faces as the only factor, but here we can test for the interaction group * faces as well (figure 37 for [ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/37a.jpg), [Spectrum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/37b.jpg) and [ERSP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/37c.jpg)).
