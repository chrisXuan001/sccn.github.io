The [one sample t-test](https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/wiki/5.-One-sample-t-test-(contrasting-Full-Faces-vs-Scrambled-Faces-at-the-subject-level)) was computed on the contrasts faces vs scrambled faces, i.e. on differences. To fully appreciate the effect, we thus have to check differences on contrasts before looking at raw data.

Note that because we use a Bayesian confidence interval, we test directly H1 i.e. that the difference is not 0; which differs from the one-sample t-test that tests the null, if the difference is 0 (and the significant effect tells you the you should reject the hypothesis that this is 0 - still does not prove it is!).

# Trimmed means of 1st level parameters

We start by computing the trimmed mean (because the t-test is on trimmed means) on the 1st level contrasts as we did before (figure 30 for [ERP](https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/blob/master/resources/images/30a.jpg),[Spectrum](https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/blob/master/resources/images/30b.jpg) and [ERSP](https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/blob/master/resources/images/30c.jpg)), thus reflecting the t/p value maps.

## Trimmed mean differences of raw data

To look at the data, we compute the **weighted mean for all famous and unfamiliar faces** (pool conditions [1 2 3 7 8 9]) and for scrambled faces (pool conditions [4 5 6]) separately and use the trimmed mean across subjects ([figure 26](https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/blob/master/resources/images/26.jpg)). Instead of visualizing each average, we can also **Make and plot a difference**, using the *single subject's data* saved when computing averages (two files are saved the mean with CI and the single subjects, that's what we use here). When plotting this, we can now see the difference directly with its confidence interval (figure 31 for [ERP](https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/blob/master/resources/images/31a.jpg),[Spectrum](https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/blob/master/resources/images/31b.jpg) and [ERSP](https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/blob/master/resources/images/31c.jpg)). The saved file can of course seen again using plot central tendencies and differences.
