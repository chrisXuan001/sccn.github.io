Let say you only want to know if famous faces differ from unfamiliar faces – again an ANOVA could be set up test the main effect and using contrasts. Alternatively, if that is the only effect of interest, you can compute a contrast at the subject level and do a paired- t-test on contrasts. 

Crucially, let's say the research question is familiar vs unfamiliar and scrambled are just a control - doing the ANOVA is a little meaningless because you now include scrambled as a condition when in fact it's a control - using contrasts we can compute those differences [1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 ; 0 0 0 -1 -1 -1 1 1 1 0] and then compute a paired t-test familiar vs unfamiliar controlled for scrambled. Note however, that the contrast within the ANOVA also controls for the presence of scrambled in the model.

# 1st level

compute 2 contrasts as described [previously](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/wiki/5.-One-sample-t-test-(contrasting-Full-Faces-vs-Scrambled-Faces-at-the-subject-level)), or in command line:

``` matlab
cd(STUDY.filepath)
[~,~,contrast.LIMO_files] = limo_get_files([],[],[],...
    fullfile(STUDY.filepath,['LIMO_' STUDY.filename(1:end-6)],...
    'LIMO_files_FaceRepAll_GLM_Channels_Time_WLS.txt'));
contrast.mat = [1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 0 0 0 ; 0 0 0 -1 -1 -1 1 1 1];
limo_batch('contrast only',[],contrast);
```

# 2nd level

From the 2nd level menu ([figure 9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/9.jpg)), click on ‘paired t-test’, and select the contrasts computed previously for each condition (i.e. con1 and con3). Results (figure 34 for [ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/34a.jpg), [Spectrum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/34b.jpg) and [ERSP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/34c.jpg)) are very similar to figure 33 ([ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/33a.jpg), [Spectrum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/33b.jpg) and [ERSP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/33c.jpg) i.e. the post-hoc test from the 2-way ANOVA and differences relates to the fact that different amount of variance is accounted for, and the paired t-test uses trimmed means across subjects.

This can be executed in command line as:  
```matlab
mkdir('Paired_ttest'); cd('Paired_ttest');
chanlocs = [STUDY.filepath filesep 'limo_gp_level_chanlocs.mat'];
files = {fullfile(STUDY.filepath,['LIMO_' STUDY.filename(1:end-6)],'con_5_files_FaceRepAll_GLM_Channels_Time_WLS.txt'), ...
    fullfile(STUDY.filepath,['LIMO_' STUDY.filename(1:end-6)],'con_6_files_FaceRepAll_GLM_Channels_Time_WLS.txt')};
limo_random_select('paired t-test',chanlocs,'LIMOfiles',files,...
    'analysis_type','Full scalp analysis', 'type','Channels','nboot',1000,'tfce',0);
```
