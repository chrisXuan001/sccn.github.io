Given the (non-significant) group effect observed in the between subjects’ ANOVA with repeated factor, we can also do a simple two samples t-tests between groups 1 and 2. From the 2nd level GUI ([figure 9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/9.jpg)), click on two samples t-test, and select the beta files for group 1 and group 2. Let’s select parameter 1, i.e. famous faces ([figure 38](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/38.jpg)). Parameter question dialogue is repeated because you could for instance compare groups from 2 different studies, i.e. with different 1st level designs.

These steps can be executed in command line as:  
```matlab
chanlocs = XXX\derivatives\limo_gp_level_chanlocs.mat';  
Files{1} = ‘XXX\LIMO_Face_detection\Beta_files_Gp1_Faces_GLM_Channels_Frequency_WLS.txt';  
Files{2} = 'XXX\LIMO_Face_detection\Beta_files_Gp2_Faces_GLM_Channels_Frequency_WLS.txt';  
LIMOPath = limo_random_select('two-samples t-test',chanlocs,'LIMOfiles',Files,...  
   'analysis_type','Full scalp analysis', 'type','Channels','parameter',[1;1],'nboot',1000,'tfce',0);  
```

You should obtain results display on figure 39 for [ERP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/39a.jpg), [Spectrum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/39b.jpg) and [ERSP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/limo_meeg/master/resources/images/39c.jpg).
