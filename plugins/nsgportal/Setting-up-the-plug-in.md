# Setting up the plug-in

## Installing the plug-in

Generally, all plug-ins in EEGLAB, included *nsgportal*, can be installed following two different ways. For installing *nsgportal*:

1. From the EEGLAB Plug-in Manager: Launch EEGLAB and go to **File -> Manage EEGLAB extension**. The plug-in manager GUI will pop up. From this GUI look for and select the plug-in *nsgportal* from the main window, then click into the Install/Update button to install the plug-in.
2. From the web: Download the zip file with the content of the plug-in *nsgportal*  either from this [GitHub](https://github.com/sccn/nsgportal) page (select Download Zip on Github) or from the EEGLAB wiki page for plug-ins [here](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Plugin_list_all). Decompress the zip file in the folder *../eeglab/plugins* and the restart EEGLAB.

## Setting your NSG credentials
Use menu item **Tools > NSG Tools > NSG portal credentials and settings**. Simply enter your NSG user name and user password (see description above on this page). Inputs **NSG key** and **NSG Url** do not need to be modified. The entry **Output folder** is the folder where NSG data will be downloaded.
