The EEGLAB installation on NSG provides access to most of the EEGLAB plug-ins. See the table below for the list below of plug-in available from EEGLAB at NSG, as well as important links to the use of these plugins

| Plug-in name     | Plug-in description                           |  Optimized for NSG |
| ---------        | -----------                                   | --------------  
| [AMICA](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/AMICA#How_to_run_AMICA.3F_Option_2:_Neuroscience_Gateway_.28NSG.29)            | Amica ICA algorithm plugin for EEGLAB          | Yes|
| Dipfit            | Source localization of ICA components          | No|
| filrfilt          | Routines for filtering data                    |No|

Not all the EEGLAB plug-ins on NSG are optimized for use in high-performance computing resources. Currently, we are adding these capabilities to key plug-ins developed at the SCCN. Optimization of plug-ins for HPC has been indicated in the last column of the table. Documentation for the plug-ins can be found by following the link in the plug-in name.
