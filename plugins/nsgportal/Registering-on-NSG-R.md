There are two ways to access to NSG: via NSG portal and through the command line interface NSG-R. The later one use on its core *curl* commands to communicate with NSG and is the interface used by the *nsgportal* plug-in. Since both ways are interfaces to NSG, If you have already registered to NSG, you can use the same login and password for NSG-R. If you have not done so, visit [this](https://github.com/sccn/nsgportal/wiki/Registering-at-NSG) section of the wiki.
