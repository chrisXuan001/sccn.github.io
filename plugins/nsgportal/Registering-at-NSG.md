There are two ways to access to NSG: via NSG portal and through the command line interface NSG-R. The latter one uses its core curl commands to communicate with NSG and is the interface used by the nsgportal plug-in. Since both ways are interfaces to NSG, If you have already registered to NSG, you can use the same login and password for NSG-R. For the REST interface, refer to the [NSG REST documentation](https://nsgr.sdsc.edu:8443/restusers/documentation).

The first step to using the Open EEGLAB Portal is to create an NSG account [HERE](https://www.nsgportal.org/gest/reg.php) (or by clicking on "Register account" on the NSG home page).

After your account is approved by the NSG team (typically within 2 days), the second step is to enter your NSG user credentials [HERE](https://nsgdev.sdsc.edu:8443/portal2/login!input.action) (else select, "Access NSG portal" on the [NSG home page](http://www.nsgportal.org/)).
