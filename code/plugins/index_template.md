# EEGLAB plugin documentation

Below is a list of plugins that have documentation copied from GitHub. Please note that this is only a small subset of all EEGLAB plugins, as not all plugin documentation is compatible with visualization and search functionalities on the EEGLAB website. The complete list of plugins can be found [here](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/plugin_uploader/plugin_list_all.php).

{%- assign children_list = site.pages | where: "parent", "Plugins" -%}
{% include toc_nav.html nav=children_list %}
