## Troubleshooting

On both MAC and Windows, you might need to run EEGLAB as an administrator to be able to access some folders.

On MAC OSX, you might get a message that your operating system is too old, so you should try an older version of the compiled EEGLAB version.

Let us know if you encounter problems and how you solved them.
